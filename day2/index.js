//What you put in log's brackets becomes the output 
// It works in even strings but you have to initialze them first

console.log("Hello World")

//Assigning value to variable
// You must define variable to get output

var num=1;
console.log("num");

//If variable was declared you don't have to redeclare it

let a = 1;
a = 2;

//Assigning value of variable to another varaible

let fnum = 9;

// const keyword you declare it and initialize it and the same time
// example which shows difference between const keyword 
const b =6;
b = 4;

// Second level: BOOLEAN level

let bg;
